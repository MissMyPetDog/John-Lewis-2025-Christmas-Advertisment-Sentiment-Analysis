There are so many other obstacles in the way. I'm pleased it's raised awareness, but not entirely realistic for the majority. We didn't have social media in the 90s.

z1bRlnyQeDk,UgxIq5CeCSRvbSMsw014AaABAg,,"It could be just a Christmas campaign. And, scientifically, supported by a prior study, based on consulting a consumer panel and on customer-derived insights. Thus, technically, compliant. And then, more or less empathetic, with greater or lesser notoriety. And, at the same time, with the assessment of the direct impact generated on the promotional action’s sales. Therefore, the consequent final measurement of the results and the return on investment.

However, in this brand communication, I perceive a philosophical essence or a “human condition” of Christmas — literally, that is, even pre-linguistic: if the human being is what they feel, then let us speak of love. Without words. Sometimes — in excess or at the wrong time — words even prove to be the root cause of the generation gap between parents and children.

Congratulations to John Lewis & Partners and to the creative team. For having said so much, simply by playing music. In the hearts. Of parents and children. Of families.

It’s about the words we don’t always know how to say- The teenage son choosing a record isn’t just a gift, it’s a bridge.

There’s a strong men’s emotional health thread running through this. Men are often raised to 'hold it together', 'be strong', 'say less'. The skill and the compassion is in noticing. That’s what this advert captured for me. Don't get me wrong, I was also taken back to the '90's - my gosh it hit a nerve and I downloaded 'the record' ⁠immediately :D but what I loved was the point about recognition, empathy, and the quiet bravery of care.

Or have you forgotten?
The clue is in the first 6 letters...
It actually means ""the one who has been anointed""
There is a message right there, and a big one.

Most of all at Christmas we thank God for the word being made flesh through the Holy Spirit - a novel idea first potentially available from the time of first creation (when All Three were already present then)...

You use three words ""fun"", ""happy"" and ""joy""

FUN originally meant to cheat or hoax or make a fool of somebody, so a worthless and deceiving/distracting word, as we I think know in our hearts

HAPPY means to have a chance, to have some luck - so better, but nothing blessed or divine, just the way the cookie crumbles sometimes.

JOY relates to being glad and rejoicing, but ""enjoy"" suggests more of it - but the birth of Jesus is as much joy as we will ever need, and joy is a divine gift founded in love and truth that can be experienced even in the face of sadness and difficulty, because Father, Son and Holy Spirit offer us resilience against bad worldly things.

The word you missed - a great word - is ""merry"". 
Not by chance do we say ""Merry Christmas"" and ""make merry"". When the Prodigal Son returned, the Father ordered all to make merry...
With merry we make an effort to find joy, even if the circumstances do not encourage that - while that might involve more or less alcohol (""he became slightly merry""), it mainly involves spirit, effort, FORGIVENESS, togetherness  - as in the film above. The greatest gift of the Holy Trinity is mercy and forgiveness, and if we can ""GET OVER IT"" then we are doing God's work here on Earth, here in the awful 1 John 5:19 world.

Try this:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbsjd7tRA7M (I am far from being a Mormon, but, through the Holy Spirit, I look for joy and beauty wherever it is to be found) - this shows the spirit of Christmas better than I ever can.",@sidpheasant7585,0,2025-11-08T09:00:35Z,reply

Exactly, he’s probably heard his dad mention it if he’s heard it somewhere talking to friends or on the radio and said how much he likes it so the son looked it up.

z1bRlnyQeDk,Ugzyeu-ORDj-37Mta1J4AaABAg,,"John Lewis, you've absolutely smashed it for me this year. 

I’m 46, and lately I’ve been looking back a lot… my younger self, my rave days, the freedom, the late nights.
I miss it more than I expected.

These last few years have been rough.
My mental health took a dip and it affected my kids.
My youngest and I have had the hardest time.
My career took over much of my parenting and I missed more than I want to admit.

But life has a way of giving us a second chance.
This past year he’s had his own struggles, and somehow that opened a space for both of us to heal.
He’s helped me.
I’ve helped him.
We’ve met each other again.

And the funny thing is — we found our way back through music.
House music.
The beats of my younger days.
We share songs, talk about memories, dance in the kitchen, gone to gigs
Different generations, same rhythm.

To me, that’s what parenting — and Christmas — is about.
Not being perfect.
Not getting it all right the first time.
But finding a way to reconnect, laugh again, and love each other in real, everyday ways.

Here’s to second chances.
To softer hearts.
To music that carries us home.

I look back and think that was the best years of my life but then I remember that it all pales in to insignificance when my boy calls me dad asks for advice or even gives me advice. This advert proper hits home yes those years were fun and exciting and I met my wife and got married but all the years after being a dad and husband are way more fun and mean more.

Once he became a father, everything changed-those experiences were left behind as his priorities shifted toward his responsibilities. But through the present and the music, he was taken back to that part of himself, reminded of what he once loved. Then came the realisation that this part of his life had faded when he became a dad. Yet, having his son recognise and connect with that passion-sharing that moment together-was deeply meaningful, because his son is now his whole world.",@pt4005,0,2025-11-06T10:55:45Z,top

The son has bought the record to remind the Dad of his younger days, but no matter how good those days were, the days that came after, with him in the world, were so much more precious. And the Dad clearly appreciates the silent gesture, as your children reach those teenage and pre-teen years, they communicate less and less, but the son is letting the gift speak for him.

I felt no need to suddenly buy from their website .. it made me want to get my tape deck out and play my 90’s tracks to my 13 yer old and tell him about life without phones, social media, meeting friends without texting .. you just knew they’d be there .. the time of that Alison Limerick track was amazing .. I know some won’t get it but I do feel a whole lot of you will ..and it just prompts you to share your good times and memories and have quality time chattering .. best gift ever JL!! No commercial pressure to buy buy buy .. a lovely advert encouraging good relations and just making time for each other ❤️",@aliceh1977,1,2025-11-06T01:08:54Z,top

z1bRlnyQeDk,Ugy5rMex-71V3ry0KuZ4AaABAg,,I think this is rather beautiful and beautifully cast and acted. For me I think there are a mix of meanings running through. I see the main story being that the dad is rather sad and reflects on raising his son and now the son being older. Perhaps he is feeling distant from him or the life they live is not what it was. Burdens of the now are real and life is.more difficult. So the son does what children do best; he shows loves and gives the dad hope by 'taking him back to a happier time'. He then helps the dad maybe grappling with age and to let go of his youth and reconnect with what is important now; his family. The passing of time with its joy and sadness eh; so lovely to capture this for all us parents. The joy of children and love and the sadness of loss and ageing. There's always time to dance and have a hug with the ones we love. The best tune chosen too! The 90s were a great time to be alive!,@RebeccaBradshaw-t7o,2,2025-11-05T23:26:17Z,top

z1bRlnyQeDk,UgweDCUbGG72h5IymcZ4AaABAg,,"So, an emotionally stunted man has an insidious and pernicious resentment of his (25 year old?) autistic son because he grew up. The son (a people pleaser due to his father's neglect) mirrors his father's awkwardness and is too scared to hand him the thoughtful gift that he naively hopes will make his father validate him as an autonomous person and love him unconditionally. The father is too selfish to do this and continues to infantalise his son to the point of picturing him as a newborn, albeit now at least showing him some of the affection which has clearly been lacking throughout his life. 

This should be a cautionary tale about fostering healthy relationships with your children so that they don't end up parenting you, like in this advert.

Some people (imagine it’ll be young gen z) will say hes autistic because they can’t seem to grasp the concept of a normal family being on tv anymore.
The son got him that present last and the family left dad to play it alone as a bit of nostalgia. It’s the sons way of saying he knows dad used to be young and go out clubbing, dad has his moment being young again then realises how much he loves his family and wouldn’t change it.
People saying the son is autistic just coz he doesn’t say anything and is wearing big headphones are weird.

He could be a DJ who got those for Christmas and got his dad that song on vinyl.

Yes!

And on top of that, usually a ""typical"" family of Mum/Dad/2kids which is really not that common these days. I also think about how I saw adverts from early childhood and as an only child of a single Mum, became hyper aware that this is NOT my version of reality as a child and it made me yearn to be ""normal"" like the families in adverts for cereal etc. I wonder if it brainwashed me to believe that you haven't made it unless you manage to create a cereal box family. . . which lead me to go into alarm mode when I reached 40 childless and made some pretty insane choices which have caused a lot of pain ... but I helped create a little human who I hope will appreciate rave music one day soon.",@M9Diry,9,2025-11-05T14:30:41Z,reply

I've not seen a positive reaction to a Christmas advert on this level  in what feels like ages. Credit to everyone involved. I think last Christmas there was so much bad feeling around adverts. I think a lot had crossed a line filling it with current day nonsense and I've noticed a lot more traditional themed adverts so far this year.

No pressure to buy from their website but encouraging good relations and parents sharing their memories and good times with the youth of today. I think it’s brilliant. I love that it’s not the usual commercial con manipulating us to spend on stuff people don’t need but we buy this stuff as we feel we have to. They’ve set an example of what the festive season should be about .. the best gift is time together .. I am biased as a 90’s raver but I truly feel our experiences must be shared as it was a special time. Not everyone will get this advert but o know so many will. Can’t please everyone hey .. this is Britain! Open your minds folks and see the good in this .. share your funtimes and memories with your beloveds or whoever you wish to .. don’t be quick to criticise .. you’re creating your own misery .. see the good and give JL a high five 🙌🏼,@aliceh1977,11,2025-11-06T01:18:53Z,reply
