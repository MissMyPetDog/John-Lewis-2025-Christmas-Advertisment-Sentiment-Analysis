dc5S4IV_NeA,Ugx-BEKaq1FbSUBEgz14AaABAg,,"When I first saw this advert on YouTube I cried buckets, but now I find for TV, they have edited the advert so it is shorter, and it does not have the same emotional tear-jerking effect it had the first time round.
I guess they don’t want people being blubbering emotional wrecks every time they see it, but I think it has a social and very important role in seeing the advert in its full length.
Firstly, there is the Father/Son relationship which also brings on the discussion with Fathers as Role Models and especially the discussion of absent Fathers ( including Father’s ) who are no longer here in their Son’s life.
Seeing the full length of this advert the way it should naturally be shown, brings the natural message of Father and Sons relationships, home very clearly, especially at this special time of Christmas.❤",@rogerhoward7498,0,2025-11-18T21:16:14Z,top

Maybe you're not in your 40's or 50's either. Maybe you don't feel your own mortality and how time is so fleating and precious? I didn't think about my own mortality until I hit my late 30's when a friend died who was the same age. 

Maybe you don't have kids? My daughter is nearly 6 and my son is 2. I can't believe it. I know they'll be 18 before I know it. 

I remember so many nights out dancing to Where Love Lives. My nights out clubbing every week and partying at uni feel like yesterday, but it's 20 years since I left uni. I feel like I could touch it. It's gone in such a flash.
